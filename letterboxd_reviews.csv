Parasite reviews
"Update: Now in video formThere is a house on a hill, and there are people in it. And they're nice, but not really. There is a garden, and there they get a lot of sunlight. And it is nice, and they get to sleep there sometimes.There is a house underground, and there are people in it. And they're the first to tell you that they're not very nice: they're con-men, grifters, forgers and imposters. They sit among stink‚Ä¶"
call me by your name‚Äôs cum peach walked so parasite‚Äôs killer peach could run
Another Bong hit.
Our expectations were high but HOLY FUCK
"One detail I noticed this time around is that Min and Mr. Park both react the same way to being asked if they like or love the people that they're romantically involved with‚Äì by laughing. And in Mr. Park's case, giving a sarcastic answer that undercuts his saying 'yes'. Min and Mr. Park are both seen as powerful figures deserving of respect, and the way they dismissively respond to an earnest question about whether they truly care for the people‚Ä¶"
a question to people who rate this 4.5: what more do you want literally what more do you want
The bloody napkin scene....top 3 scenes of all time. Hands down.
morse code me by your name and i'll morse code you by mine
The tent won‚Äôt leak. It‚Äôs from America.
"Watched with a live orchestra and an introduction by Bong. It was one of my favorite experiences at a theatre, obviously."
maybe the real parasite... was the friends we made along the way
"crazy rich asians walked, so that they could get stabbed in parasite"
A garden party.A basement.A stone.A cake.A knife.A seizure.A car-key.A sausage skewer.A smell.A murder.The most thrilling scene in years.
"Jessica, only child ‚úåÔ∏è from Illinois Chicago, classmate of Kim Jin-mo, he‚Äôs your cousin‚úåÔ∏è üéº¬†
Easily, without a doubt, the best hook of 2019"
parasite is my minimalist architecture porn mmm yes unplastered grey stone walls mahogany floor and impractical enormous glass panels fuck my shit up
"I'M SCREAMING I'M CRYING THIS IS THE BEST SHIT THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED THE FILM THAT TRULY MADE ME A CINEPHILE IS THE FIRST FOREIGN FILM TO EVER WIN BEST PICTURE WE WON bong can now finally go and drink his guts out, bless his heart"

I hadn't seen a trailer and had no idea what the premise of it even was and BOY OH BOY did I have a wonderful couple of hours. Pure movie joy.
"I've come to make an announcement:
The Academy is a bitch ass motherfucker. They pissed on Song Kang-Ho's chances of getting a Supporting Actor nod. That's right, this bunch of quilly dicks pissed all over a truly nuanced and powerful performance and they said Brad Pitt's dick was ""this big"" and I said ""that's disgusting"".
So I'm making a callout post on my letterboxd dot com: Academy, you got a small dick, its the size of this peach except way‚Ä¶"
"Unintentionally decided now, in the middle of my Ansel binge, was a good time to rewatch this. Not realizing I also decided to rewatch Parasite in the middle of my Noah Centineo marathon. Just putting that out there as a way of thanking Bong for getting me through these tough times."
"Bong Joon-ho, the sui generis South Korean auteur behind unclassifiable modern wonders like ‚ÄúBarking Dogs Never Bite‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Host,‚Äù has always made films that refuse to fit the narrow parameters of any particular genre. Each of them is built atop a bedrock of comic violence that Bong uses to support the weight of the heavy stories he places on top of it, but simply categorizing ‚ÄúSnowpiercer‚Äù as science-fiction or ‚ÄúMemories of Murder‚Äù as a mystery would require you to‚Ä¶"
"""No one can imitate North Korean news anchors like you"" gotta be the rarest compliment ever"
"Holy fucking shit. I can‚Äôt tell if this movie is a masterpiece or if Bong Joon-ho himself is the masterpiece.
The poster for this film quotes David Ehrlich‚Äôs Indiewire review that says this solidifies his movies as a genre of their own, and he‚Äôs totally right. I couldn‚Äôt possibly place this into a solid genre, but every little genre it does dip into, it knocks out of the park. I loved it. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I went‚Ä¶"
"‚ÄúDad, today I made a plan.‚Äù
It‚Äôs absolutely fucking absurd that Song Kang-Ho did not get any Oscar attention for his role in this film. He gives the most expressive, wide-ranging performance of the year. I mean, the entire ensemble is outstanding (I think I‚Äôve already said how terrific Cho Yeo-jeong‚Äôs comedic performance is) but Song is the emotional center of this film both in its funniest and it‚Äôs most tragic moments. Also, after five viewings (I know) of this‚Ä¶"
"Something I‚Äôve wondered since the first viewing: toward the end when Ki-Woo mentions ‚Äúthe doctor who looked nothing like a doctor‚Äù and ‚Äúthe lawyer who looked nothing like a lawyer,‚Äù is this meant to subtly hint that everyone in this universe is faking it, not just the Kims?"
"I saw someone on Twitter doing that annoying thing where they sneer at the idea that a movie that people love really could be as good as they say and then asking for more opinions, hoping to find just one person who says something like ""it was fine"" and then latch onto that one take as the definitive proof that there's some sort of conspiracy (?) to declare a film as great when it's actually ""just fine."" It's a very‚Ä¶"
"despite what mr. park might think, this movie smells so fucking good"
"if this doesn‚Äôt win the palme d‚Äôor i‚Äôm burning the palais to the ground
ETA WE FUCKIN DID IT BONG WON THE PALME"
You are not ready for this film. I shit you not. Parasite is a tour de force. The hype is true. It is really a masterpiece in its own right.
yup....... this is the best movie that has ever been fucking made
not to sound dramatic but that flood scene changed me
"I'm not the biggest fan of reading long essays on Letterboxd, and this is definitely one of those - so if you'd like to read it on Medium with some photos and headers, check it out here: link.medium.com/QdG86fMem1‚ÄúThis is so metaphorical!‚ÄùThis. This right here. Wow. I don‚Äôt wanna speak too soon, but Parasite might be among the best films of the decade. It‚Äôs the rare mix of accessible mainstream storytelling that anyone can enjoy, accompanied by plenty of‚Ä¶"
"Masterfully constructed and thoroughly compelling genre piece (effortlessly transitioning between familial drama, heist movie, satirical farce, subterranean horror) about the perverse and mutating symbiotic relationship of increasingly unequal, transactional class relationships, and who can and can't afford to be oblivious about the severe, violent material/psychic toll of capitalist accumulation. (""They say a ghost in the house brings wealth."") I think I ultimately admired this more than I felt it, it's clever and manufactured in a way that feels shiny and‚Ä¶"
"My hands shake as I type these words but people didn't lie when they said this is one of the year's best movies. To me, 2019 is over and Parasite has freakin‚Äô ended it all. You know that feeling when the movie is so good that when it ends, you feel as though a large part of your self has also departed from your body and eventually left behind a void inside you? That's exactly how I felt after watching‚Ä¶"
watched the b&w version. is it necessary? absolutely not. does it still slap? hell yeah.
Best of the Decade.¬†I‚Äôve never been more sure of anything.
What the fuck did you think I would give this?
"Parasite exhibits total technical and conceptual mastery of Bong‚Äôs favorite themes while simultaneously taking his oeuvre to new places. He seamlessly weaves together melodrama, satire, comedy and horror elements while ultimately centering deeply lovable and flawed characters. Anyone living in a capitalist democracy will find a lot to chew on here‚Ä¶"
"jessica, only child,from illinois, chicago.i'm a classmate of your cousin"
"‚Äúi don‚Äôt trust anyone now‚Äù
so original on every level and turns sinister so slowly that it was still shocking a second time. one of the best of the year, but you probably already knew that"
"It's frustrating to watch movies by Bong Joon-ho. He comes close sometimes, but he never quite nails it when it comes to class consciousness.This film captures conflict between the working class and the bourgeoisie, but the essence of the relationship between the two is never made explicit, never truly captured. Instead of focusing on the basic economic exploitation that is universally true in every capitalist society, the film focuses on the treatment and perception of workers by the rich.‚Ä¶"
"Uuund da h√§tten wir vermutlich das cineastische Schlusswort 2019: ‚ÄûParasite‚Äú ist eine wahre Freude. Inszenatorisch so meisterhaft konzipiert, strukturiert und gefilmt, dass man sich die Finger lecken m√∂chte, gespickt mit ein paar der sch√∂nsten Bildkompositionen, die man dieses Jahr im Kino finden wird, spielt Bong-Joon Ho mit den Genres, als w√§re es ein Kinderspiel. ‚ÄûParasite‚Äú ist packend, perfide, bisweilen absurd komisch, sensibel und bitterb√∂se, erstaunlicherweise sogar oftmals alles gleichzeitig. Und w√§hrend man noch fasziniert staunt, wie sich all diese F√§den‚Ä¶"
"‚Äúi just feel comfortable here. it feels like i was born here‚Äù
i can‚Äôt stop watching this. bonghive let‚Äôs GO!"
BEST MOTHERFUCKING PICTURE
"57Bong Joon-ho's long con. Parasite is representative of both his style and his limitations. What a stellar first act, which moves vertically between semi-basement homes and high-class spaces, tracking the financial gain and life-changing upward trajectory of one family and, most damning, the rich stasis of the other. Never has the visual repetition of a rich businessman trudging home after a loooooong day at work (so sad) been so vicious. Bong's framing allows for the class divide to showcase‚Ä¶"
